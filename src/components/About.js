       Hello, My name is Tyler Mckenzie. I'm 27 years old and live in Winnipeg, Manitoba. I've always been interested in
        gaining knowledge in as many things as I possibly can. I have a passion for fitness, art, and music to name a few; and have
        always wanted to expand my knowledge in tech and tech-related fields. I'm 
        very much a people person and enjoy working with others, but have no issues working alone either. 
        My main career goal is to find somewhere I enjoy waking up for and to expand my knowledge even further.

        My name is Tyler Mckenzie, and I'm from and currently live in Winnipeg,
        Manitoba. I've always been interested in gaining knowledge, and this
        interest led me to start coding. I have a passion for fitness, art, and
        music to name a few; and have always wanted to expand my knowledge in
        tech and tech-related fields. I'm very much a people person and enjoy
        working with others, while also being strong independently. My main
        career goal is to find somewhere I enjoy waking up for and can continue
        to grow.
